## Business Activities:

* Authored by Arthur Britto, David Schwartz, & Ryan Fugger, Ripple is the name of a payment network and the payment protocol that was developed and released in 2012. Their goal is order to enable "secure, instant and nearly free global financial transactions". It is built on principles similar to those of Bitcoin, so many people consider it a cryptocurrency.

It offers a global real-time payment system that enables banks and financial institutions around the world to directly transact with each other without the need for a central correspondent. One of Ripple's differentiating componets is  FX Market Making, which is a solution enablingenterprises that opens the ability for cross-currency liquidity using a distributed network that allows foreign exchange to be externally sourced from a competitive FX marketplace or an internal FX trading desk. This minimizes FX exposure thereby lowering the volatility and counter-party risk of trades. Ripple Insights features industry updates, insider perspectives, and in-depth market analysis.
